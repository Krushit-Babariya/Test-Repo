Operator in Database:
==================
	- operator is a symbol which is used to perform some operation on 
the given operand values.
	- Database is supporting the following operators are,
	
	1. Assignment operator	=>	=
	2. Arithmetic operators	=>	+ , - , * , /
	3. Relational operators	=>	< , > , <= , >= , !=
	4. Logical operators		=>	AND,OR,NOT
	5. Set operators		=>	union,union all,intersect, minus / except.

	6. Special operators		=>	(+ve) operator	(-ve) operator
					============	============
					IN		Not IN
					BETWEEN	Not BETWEEN
					IS NULL		IS NOT NULL
					LIKE		Not LIKE


1. Assignment operator:
=====================
	- to assign a value to a variable / a attribute(column).
syntax:
======
	<column name> <assignment operator> <value>

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO = 10;
SQL> UPDATE EMP SET SAL=5000 WHERE JOB='CLERK';
SQL> DELETE FROM EMP WHERE SAL=4000;

2. Arithmetic Operators:
=====================
	- to perform some calculation like addition,subtraction,multiple and 
division.

syntax:
======
	<column name> <arithmetic operator> <value>

Ex:
waq to display all employees salaries after adding 1000?
SQL> SELECT SAL OLD_SALARY,SAL+1000 NEW_SALARY FROM EMP;

Ex:
waq to display EMPNO,ENAME,BASIC SALARY and ANNUAL SALARY of the 
employees who are working as a "MANAGER"?
SQL> SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL BASIC_SALARY,SAL*12 ANNUAL_SALARY 
         FROM EMP WHERE JOB='MANAGER';

Ex:
waq to display ENAME,BASIC SALARY and the 10% of INCREMENT salary of the 
employees?
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL BASIC_SALARY,SAL*10/100 INCREMENT_AMOUNT
         FROM EMP;

Ex:
waq to display EMPNO,ENAME,BASIC SALARY,5% of INCREMENT salary and 
TOTAL_SALARY of the employees who are working under deptno =30;
SQL> SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL BASIC_SALARY,
  2  SAL*0.05 INCREMENT_AMOUNT,SAL+SAL*0.05 TOTAL_SALARY
  3  FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=30;

3. Relational operators:
=====================
	- comparing a specific column values with conditional value in the query.

syntax:
======
	where <column name> <relational operator> <value>;

Ex:
waq to display employees whose salary is more than 1500?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL>1500;

4.LOGICAL OPERATORS:
====================
	- to check more than one condition.
	- AND,OR,NOT.

AND:
====
	- it return a value if both conditions are true in the query.

Cond1	Cond2
=====	======
T	T	---> T
T	F	---> F
F	T	---> F
F	F	---> F

syntax:
======
where <condition1> AND <condition2>

Ex:
waq to display employees who are working as a "CLERK" and whose name is 
"SMITH"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='CLERK' AND ENAME='SMITH';

OR:
===
	- it return a value if any one condition is true from the given group of
conditions in the query.

Cond1	Cond2
=====	======
T	T	---> T
T	F	---> T
F	T	---> T
F	F	---> F

syntax:
======
where <condition1> OR <condition2>

Ex:
waq to display employees who are working as a "MANAGER" or as a "SALESMAN"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='MANAGER' OR JOB='SALESMAN';

Ex:
waq to display employees who are working under deptno=30 or whose salary
is more than 1500?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=30 OR SAL>1500;

NOT:
====
	- it returns all values except the given conditional values in the query.

syntax:
=======
where not <condition1> and not <condition2>

Ex:
waq to display employees who are not working under deptno is 10,30?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE NOT DEPTNO=10 AND NOT DEPTNO=30;

5) SET OPERATORS:
=================
	- set operators are used to combined the results of two select queries
as a single set of values.

syntax:
=======
	<select query1> <set operator> <select query2>;

Ex:
	A={10,20,30}	B={30,40,50}
UNION:
======
	- it combined two sets values without duplicate values.
	A U B={10,20,30,40,50}


UNION ALL:
==========
	- it combined two sets values with duplicate values.
	A UL B ={ 10,20,30,30,40,50}

INTERSECT:
==========
	- it returns common values.
	A I B = {30}

EXCEPT / MINUS:
===============
	- it returns all values from left set which are not found in right set.
	A - B ={10,20}
	B - A ={40,50}

DEMO_TABLES:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP_HYD;

       EID ENAME             SAL
---------- ---------- ----------
      1021 SMITH           85000
      1022 ALLEN           48000
      1023 WARD            74000

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP_CHENNAI;

       EID ENAME             SAL
---------- ---------- ----------
      1021 SMITH           85000
      1024 JONES           55000
      1025 MILLER          25000

Ex:
waq to list out all employees details who are working under NARESHIT organization?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP_HYD UNION ALL SELECT * FROM EMP_CHENNAI; (including duplicates)
		(or)
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP_HYD UNION SELECT * FROM EMP_CHENNAI; (excluding duplicates)

Ex:
waq to list out the employees who are working in both branches?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP_HYD INTERSECT SELECT * FROM EMP_CHENNAI;

Ex:
waq to list out employees NAMES who are working under CHENNAI branch but not
in HYD branch?
SQL> SELECT ENAME FROM EMP_CHENNAI
  2  MINUS / EXCEPT
  3  SELECT ENAME FROM EMP_HYD;

BASIC RULES:
============
1.  no.of columns should be same in both select statements.
2. order of the columns and datatypes of columns must be match in both select
statements.
======================================================================
6. Special operators:
==================
IN :
===	
	- comparing the list of values based on a single condition.

syntax:
=======
	where <column name> IN(value1,value2,............)

Ex:
waq to list out employees whose EMPNO is 7369,7566,7788,7900?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN(7369,7566,7788,7900);

Ex:
waq to list out employees who are not working as a "clerk","salesman","manager"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB NOT IN('CLERK','SALESMAN','MANAGER');

BETWEEN:
=========
	- comparing a particular range value.

syntax:
=======
	where <column name> between <low value> and <high value>;

Basic Rules:
===========
1. it returns all values including source and destination values from the 
given range value.

2. it can apply on low value to high value but not high to low.

3. it can implement with "AND" operator only.

Ex:
waq to display employees whose salary is between 1500 to 3000?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1500 AND 3000;

Ex:
waq to display employees whose salary is not between 1500 to 3000?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL NOT BETWEEN 1500 AND 3000;

IS NULL :
========
	- a NULL is a empty / unknow / undefined value in a table.
	- NUll != 0 and NULL != space.
	- to find out the empty block is a table then we use a special operator
 "IS" keyword.

syntax:
======
	where <column name> is null

Ex:
waq to display employees whose MGR is empty ?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE MGR IS NULL;

Ex:
waq to display employees whose COMMISSION is empty ?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL;

Ex:
waq to display employees whose COMMISSION is not empty ?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL;

LIKE:
=====
	- to comparing a specific character pattern wise.
	- when we use "like" operator we should use the following 
	Wildcard Operators:
		>  % : it represent the remaining group of char's after 
			selected character in the expression
		>  _  : counting a single character from the expression.
	Ex:
	to display employees whose name starts with "S" character?
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';
		
		S	%
		==	===
		S	MITH
		S	AI
		S	UMAN
		S	COTT
		S	URESH

	Ex:
	to display employees whose name is having 4 characters?
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '____';
		SMITH
		ALLEN
		WARD
		MILLER ----------------------------> WARD,KING,FORD
		KING
		WARNER
		FORD

Ex:
to display employees who are joined in 1981?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '%81';

Ex:
to display employees who are joined in the month of "december" ?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '%DEC%';

Ex:
to display employees who are joined in the month of "june", "december"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '%JUN%' OR HIREDATE LIKE '%DEC%';

EX:
to display employees who are joined in the month of "december" in 1980?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '%DEC%' AND HIREDATE LIKE '%80';

LIKE OPERATOR WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
========================================
DEMO_TABLE:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER;

       CID CNAME            CAGE
---------- ---------- 	----------
         1 WAR_NER           23
         2 MILL@ER            24
         3 %WARD             25
         4 TRUN#ER           23
         5 _ADAMS             25
         6 KAMAL@             23

Ex:
to display customers whose name is having "@" symbol?
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%@%';

Ex:
to display customers whose name is having "#" symbol?
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%#%';

Ex:
to display customers whose name is having "_" symbol?
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%_%';----->wrong result

Ex:
to display customers whose name is having "%" symbol?
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%%%';----->wrong result

	- By default db server will treat "_ , %" as a wildcard operators but not 
treat as a special characters so that it returns wrong result.
	- To overcome the above problem we should use a pre-defined keyword
is called as "ESCAPE '\' ".

solution:
========
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%\_%'ESCAPE'\';
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CNAME LIKE '%\%%'ESCAPE'\';

Ex:
to display employees whose name not starts with "S" character?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME NOT LIKE 'S%';
