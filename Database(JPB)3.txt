CLAUSES IN DATABASE:
=====================
	- it is a statement which is used to add to sql query to providing some
additional facilities are "Filtering rows,Sorting values,Grouping data,
Finding sub total and grand total" based on column/columns in a table automatically.

Types of clauses:
===============
	i) Where
	ii) Order by
	iii) Group by
	iv) Having
	v) Rollup
	vi) Cube

syntax:
======
	<SQL QUERY> + <CLAUSE STATEMENT>;


i) Where :
==========
	- is used for filtering rows before grouping data in a table.
	- where clause condition is working on each individual row in a table.
	- it can apply on "select,update,delete" commands only.
syntax:
======
	where <filtering condition>;

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FORM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7788;
SQL> UPDATE EMP SET SAL=55000 WHERE JOB='PRESIDENT';
SQL> DELETE FROM EMP WHERE SAL=23000;

ii) Order by:
==========
	- is used to arrange a particular column values in ascending / descending
order.by default order by clause is arranging values in "ascending order" only.if
we want to arrange values in descending order then use a keyword is called as 
"DESC".
	- it can apply on "select command" only.

syntax:
=======
select * / <list of columns> from <table name> order by <column name1> <asc/desc>,
<column name2> <asc> / <desc>,.............................;

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY SAL;
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY SAL DESC;

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY ENAME;
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY ENAME DESC;

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY HIREDATE;
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY HIREDATE DESC;

Ex:
waq to arrange employees salaries in descending order who are working as a
"salesman"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='SALESMAN' ORDER BY SAL DESC;

Ex:
waq to arrange employees salaries in descending order and  their deptno's are 
ascending for each deptno wise?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY DEPTNO,SAL DESC;

Note:
=====
	- order by clause can apply on not only column names even though we
can apply on position of column in SELECT query.

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY SAL DESC;
		(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY 6 DESC;

SQL> SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ORDER BY 3 DESC;
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ORDER BY 2 DESC;
SQL> SELECT SAL FROM EMP ORDER BY 1 DESC;

GROUP BY:
==========
	- this clause is used for grouping a specific column / columns data.
	- when we use "group by" clause we should use an aggregative / grouping
functions are Count(),Sum(),Avg(),Min() and Max().
	- it can apply on "select command" only.

syntax:
=======
select <column name1>,<column name2>,.......,<aggregative function name1>,.......
from <table name> group by(<column name1>,<column name2>,........);

Ex:
DEMO_TABLE:
============
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;

      STID SNAME      GENDER
----------    ---------- 	----------
         1 SMITH      	FEMALE
         2 MILLER     	MALE

         4 ALLEN      	FEMALE
         5 JONES      	FEMALE

EX:
waq to find out the total students in a class room?
SQL> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STUDENTS;

  COUNT(*)
----------
         5

EX:
waq to find out the no. of male students in a class room?
SQL> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STUDENTS WHERE GENDER='MALE';

  COUNT(*)
----------
         2

Ex:
waq to findout no.of students in each gender wise?
SQL> SELECT GENDER,COUNT(*) AS NO_OF_STUDENTS
  2  FROM STUDENTS GROUP BY GENDER;

GENDER     NO_OF_STUDENTS
---------- 	---------------------------------
MALE                    2
FEMALE                3

Ex:
waq to display no.of employees working in each job ?
SQL> SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) AS NO_OF_EMPLOYEES FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB;

EX:
waq to display no.of employees working in each job along with their deptno wise?
SQL> SELECT JOB,DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP 
GROUP BY JOB,DEPTNO 
ORDER BY JOB,DEPTNO;

JOB           DEPTNO   	COUNT(*)
--------- 	--------------- 	---------
CLERK             10          	1
CLERK             20          	2
CLERK             30          	1
...........	 ..............		......

Ex:
waq to display sum of salaries of each deptno wise?
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO ORDER  BY DEPTNO;

Ex:
waq to display,
	- no.of employees
	- sum of salaries
	- average of salary
	- maximum salary
	- minimum salary 
of each deptno wise?

SOL:
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,
    COUNT(*)AS NO_OF_EMPLOYEES,
    SUM(SAL)AS TOTAL_SALARY,
    AVG(SAL)AS AVG_SALARY,
    MAX(SAL)AS MAX_SALARY,
    MIN(SAL)AS MIN_SALARY
    FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO ORDER BY DEPTNO;

HAVING:
========
	- it is used for filtering rows after grouping data in a table.
	- having clause can be implemented along with "group by" clause.
	- it can apply on "select command" only.

syntax:
=======
select <column name1>,<column name2>,.......,<aggregative function name1>,.......
from <table name> group by <column name1>,<column name2>,........................
having <filtering condition>;

Ex:
waq to display jobs from emp table in which job the no.of employees are more than
3?
SQL> SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB
  2  HAVING COUNT(*)>3;

JOB         		COUNT(*)
--------- 		----------
CLERK              	4
SALESMAN           	4

EX:
waq to display deptno's from emp table in which deptno the sum of salary is 
less than 10000?
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO
  2  HAVING SUM(SAL)<10000 ORDER BY DEPTNO;

    DEPTNO   	SUM(SAL)
---------- 		----------
        10       	8750
        30       	9400

USING ALL CLAUSES IN A SINGLE SELECT STATEMENT:
=================================================
SYNTAX:
========
select <column name1>,<column name2>,.......,<aggregative function name1>,.....
from <table name> [ where <filtering condition>
		 group by <column name1>,.........
		 having <filtering condition>
		 order by <column name1> <asc/desc>,......
		];


Ex:
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP
  2     WHERE SAL>1000
  3     GROUP BY DEPTNO
  4     HAVING COUNT(*)>3
  5     ORDER BY DEPTNO;

    DEPTNO   	COUNT(*)
---------------- 	----------
        20          	4
        30          	5

ROLLUP & CUBE:
==============
	- these are special clauses in database.
	- which will use to find sub total and grand total based on column/columns.
	- mostly these clauses are used in "datawarehouse" for data summerizing / 
describing" purpose.

Here,
	Rollup : is used to find sub & grand total based on a single column.
	Cube   : is used to find sub & grand total basd on multiple columns.
	
	NOTE : these clauses are used along with "group by" clause only.

syntax for ROLLUP:
================
select <column name1>,<column name2>,.......,<aggregative function name1>,.....
from <table name> group by rollup(<column name1>,<column name2>,.........);
			        .........................    ..................................
				|		 |
			operational column		supporting columns

Ex on rollup with a single column:
=============================
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY ROLLUP(DEPTNO);

Ex on rollup with multiple columns:
=============================
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,JOB,COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY ROLLUP(DEPTNO,JOB);
	Here,
		leading column is "DEPTNO".

SQL> SELECT JOB,DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY ROLLUP(JOB,DEPTNO);

	Here,
		leading column is "JOB".


syntax for CUBE:
================
select <column name1>,<column name2>,.......,<aggregative function name1>,.....
from <table name> group by cube(<column name1>,<column name2>,.........);
			        ...........................................................
					|		 
			        all columns are operational columns		


Ex on cube with a single column:
============================
SQL> SELECT DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY CUBE(DEPTNO) 
ORDER BY DEPTNO;

Ex on cube with multiple columns:
=============================
SQL> SELECT JOB,DEPTNO,COUNT(*) FROM EMP
         GROUP BY CUBE(JOB,DEPTNO) ORDER BY JOB,DEPTNO;
