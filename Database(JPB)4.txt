JOINS:
======
	- Generally in RDBMS data can be organized into multiple tables.if we 
want to retrieve the required data from those multiple tables then we use a 
techique is called as "JOINS".
	- JOINS are used to retrieve / read the data / information from multiple
tables at a time.

Types of joins:
=============
	1. Inner join 
		- equi join 
		- non-equi join
	2. Outer joins
		- left outer join
		- right outer join
		- full outer join
	3. Cross join 
	4. Natural join
	5. Self join

Syntax:
=======
select * from <table name1> [table alias name1] <join key> <table name2> [table alias name2> on <joining condition>;

1. Inner join :
============
	i) Equi join:
	===========
		- When we are retrieving data from multiple tables based on
an " = " operator is called as "equi join".
		- When we use equi join we have atleast one common column
name (optional) in both tables and those columns datatypes must be same.
		- having relationship between tables are optional.
		- it always retrieve matching data(rows) only.

syntax for equi join:
=================
	ON <tn1>.<common column name> = <tn2>.<common column name>;

DEMO_TABLES:
==============
SQL> SELECT * FROM COURSE;

       CID CNAME        CFEE
---------- ---------- 	----------
        10 DB               5000
        20 JAVA           6000
        30 .NET            8000
        40 PYTHON      3500

SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;

      STID SNAME       CID
---------- ---------- 	----------
         1 SMITH             10
         2 ALLEN             10
         3 JONES             30
         4 ADAMS            20
         5 SCOTT
Ex:
waq to fetch students and their corresponding course details from students,course
tables by using equi join / inner join ?
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS JOIN COURSE
         ON STUDENTS.CID=COURSE.CID;
		(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S INNER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

RULE OF JOINS:
=============
	 a row in a table is comparing with all rows in another table.
		
Ex:
waq to display student names who are joined in "DB" course?
SQL> SELECT SNAME FROM STUDENTS S INNER JOIN COURSE C
  2  ON S.CID=C.CID WHERE CNAME='DB';
		(OR)
SQL> SELECT SNAME FROM STUDENTS S INNER JOIN COURSE C
  2  ON S.CID=C.CID AND CNAME='DB';

Ex:
waq to display employees details who are working in the location is "CHICAGO"
from EMP,DEPT tables by using inner join / equi join?		
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
  2  ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO WHERE LOC='CHICAGO';

Ex:
waq to display sum of salaries of each department name wise by using inner / equi join?
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
         ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME;

Ex:
waq to display departments from emp,dept tables if the sum of salary of a department 
is more than 10000?
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
         ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME HAVING SUM(SAL)>10000;

2. Outer joins:
============
	- to retrieving matching and also unmatching rows(data) from multiple
tables.this technique is again classified into three types,
	i) left outer join
	ii) right outer join
	iii) full outer join

i) left outer join:
==============
	- retrieving matching rows from both tables and unmatching rows from
left side table only.
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S LEFT OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

ii) right outer join:
================
	- retrieving matching rows from both tables and unmatching rows from
right side table only.
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S RIGHT OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

iii) full outer join:
===============
	- retrieving matching & unmatching rows from both tables.

SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S FULL OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

NON-EQUI JOIN:
==============
	- retrieving data from multiple tables based on any operator except an
"=" operator.
	- in this join we can use the following operators are,
		<,>,<=,>=,!=,between,and,or,.......etc

DEMO_TABLES:
==============
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1;

       SNO NAME
---------- ----------
        10 SMITH
        20 ALLEN

SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST2;

       SNO        SAL
----------         ----------
        10      25000
        30      32000

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 INNER JOIN TEST2 ON TEST1.SNO>TEST2.SNO;

       SNO NAME              SNO        SAL
----------    ----------              ----------    ----------
        20 ALLEN              10          25000

Ex:
waq to display employees whose salary is between low salary and high salary?
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP INNER JOIN
         SALGRADE ON SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;
		(OR)
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP INNER JOIN
         SALGRADE ON (SAL>=LOSAL) AND (SAL<=HISAL);

CROSS JOIN:
===========
	- joining two or more than two tables without any condition.
	- in this cross join each row of a table will joins with each row of another table 
for example a table is having (m) no.of rows and another table is having (n) no.of rows then
the result is (mxn) rows.
	- this cross join is also called as "cartisean join".
Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM COURSE CROSS JOIN STUDENTS;
		(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM COURSE C CROSS JOIN STUDENTS S;

DEMO_TABLES:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM ITEMS1;

       SNO 	INAME           	PRICE
---------- 	---------- 		----------
         1 	BURGER             	85
         2 	PIZZA             	150

SQL> SELECT * FROM ITEMS2;

       SNO 	INAME           	PRICE
---------- 	---------- 		----------
      1001 	PEPSI              	20
      1002 	COCACOLA           	25

EX:
SQL> SELECT I1.INAME,I1.PRICE,I2.INAME,I2.PRICE,
  2  I1.PRICE+I2.PRICE AS TOTAL_BILL_AMOUNT
  3  FROM ITEMS1 I1 CROSS JOIN ITEMS2 I2;

SELF JOIN:
==========
	- joining a table by itself is called as "self join".
			(or)
	- comparing data by itself is called as "self join".

Note:
=====
1. self join technique is used  / implementing on a single table only.
2. it can be implemented with help of alias names without alias names we cannot implement
self join techinque.
3. Once we create a alias name internally database server will prepare virtual tables on each
alias name.
4. we can create any no.of alias names on a single table but each alias name should be 
different.

	- there are two levels to implement self join mechanism,

Level-1:
======
	- comparing a single column values by itself with in the table.

Level-2:
======
	- comparing two different columns values to each other with in the table.

DEMO_TABLE:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST;

ENAME      LOC
---------- 	----------
SMITH      HYD
ALLEN      MUMBAI
JONES      HYD
ADAMS      KERALA
MILLER     CHENNAI

Ex on comparing a single column values by itself:
===========================================
Ex:
waq to display employees who are working in the same location where the employee 
"SMITH" is also working?

solution:
=======
SQL> SELECT T1.ENAME,T1.LOC FROM TEST T1 JOIN TEST T2
         ON T1.LOC=T2.LOC AND T2.ENAME='SMITH';

ENAME      LOC
---------- 	----------
SMITH      HYD
JONES      HYD

Ex:
waq to display employees whose salary is same as the employee "SCOTT" salary?
SQL> SELECT E1.ENAME,E1.SAL FROM EMP E1 JOIN EMP E2
  2  ON E1.SAL=E2.SAL AND E2.ENAME='SCOTT';

ENAME             SAL
---------- 	      ----------
SCOTT            3000
SMITH            3000

Ex on comparing two different columns values to each other:
====================================================
Ex:
waq to display managers and their employees from emp table?
SQL> SELECT M.ENAME AS MANAGER,E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEES
         FROM EMP E JOIN EMP M ON M.EMPNO=E.MGR;

Ex:
waq to display employees who are joined before their manager?
SQL> SELECT M.ENAME AS MANAGER,M.HIREDATE AS MDOJ,E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE,
  2  E.HIREDATE AS EDOJ FROM EMP E JOIN EMP M
  3  ON M.EMPNO=E.MGR AND E.HIREDATE<M.HIREDATE;

EX:
waq to display employees whose salary is more than their manager?
SQL> SELECT M.ENAME AS MANAGER,M.SAL MSALARY,
  2  E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE,E.SAL ESALARY FROM EMP E
  3  JOIN EMP M ON M.EMPNO=E.MGR AND E.SAL>M.SAL;

Natural join:
===========
	- Natural join is similar to equi join.
	- SQLSERVER is not support "Natural Join" whereas ORACLE is supporting
	"Natural join".

Equi join VS Natural join:
=====================
	
	Equi join				Natural join
	========				==========
1. Equi join condition is 			1. Natural join condition is 
prepared by user explicitly.			prepared by oracle db implicitly(automatically).

2. Here,common colum name			2. Here,common column name
is a optional.					is mandatory.

3. retrieving data from multiple 		3. retrieving data from multiple
tables including duplicate columns.		tables excluding duplicate columns.

Similarities of equi & natural join:
============================
1. Both are retrieving data from multiple tables based on an " = " operator.
2. Both are retrieving matching rows(data) only.

HOW TO JOIN MORE THAN TWO TABLES:
===================================
SYNTAX:
========
SELECT * FROM <TABLE NAME1> <JOIN KEY> <TABLE NAME2>
ON <JOIN CONDITION1> <JOIN KEY> <TABLE NAME3> 
ON <JOIN CONDITION2> <JOIN KEY> <TABLE NAME4>
ON <JOIN CONDITION3>...............................................
......................................................................................
.......................................................................................
<JOIN KEY> <TABLE NAME n> ON <JOIN CONDITION n-1>;

DEMO_TABLE:
=============
SELECT * FROM COURSE;
SELECT * FROM STUDENT;
SELECT * FROM REGISTER;

     REGNO 	REGDATE          CID
---------- 		--------- 	       ----------
      1001 		10-JUL-23         10
      1002 		11-JUL-23         20
      1003 		10-JUL-23         50

EQUI JOIN :
===========
Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S INNER JOIN COURSE C
  2  ON S.CID=C.CID INNER JOIN REGISTER R
  3  ON C.CID=R.CID;

OUTER JOINS:
============
I) LOJ:
======
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS S LEFT OUTER JOIN COURSE C
  2  ON S.CID=C.CID LEFT OUTER JOIN REGISTER R
  3  ON C.CID=R.CID;

LOGIC:
======
